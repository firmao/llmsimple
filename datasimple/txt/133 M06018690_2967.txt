A Study on High Calcium Fly ash Based Geopolymer concrete

ABSTRACT: The astronomical growths of Portland cement and hence the concrete industries tend to contribute for environmental pollution particularly the carbon dioxide emission. The contribution of ordinary Portland cement production worldwide is a bout 7% of the total greenhouse gas emission to the atmosphere. Therefore , for longterm sustainability, rate of emission of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere must be prevented from increasing. It is realized that replacemen t of cement with suitable alternatives could solve the problem. In this line, research is directed towards the development of GPC .  Most of the works reported are based only on low calcium flyash used as the main source material and hardly about the use of high calcium flyash. This article deals with the development of high calcium flyash based GPC . The influence of Molar concentration  of the sodium hydroxide in the activating solution anddifferent curing methods o n the compressive strength is studied  using trials of M30 grade and GM30 concrete .The activator/ flyash  ratio by mass is taken as 0.35  and the liquid ratio of the activating solution as 2. 5. It is observed that, ambient curing is adequate  for high calcium flyash based GPC .

Keywords: Geopolymer, source material, class C flyash , activator, consistency, setting time.

I. INTRODUCTION 
GPC  (GPC)  also known as Alkali -activated concrete or Inorganic polymer concrete  has shown to possess excellent properties such as a high early strength, low shrinkage, high resistance to freezing and thawing, sulphate attack and corrosion  in most of the pioneers work . It necessarily has a source material similar to cement and activating s olution  instead of water to act as a binder .
There are numerous publications available discussing different properties of geopolymer synthesised from different raw materials and activators. Geopolymer cement hardens rapidly at room temperature and provide s compressive strength of 20MPa  after only 4 hours at 20oC and the final 28 day strength in the range of 70-100 MPa and their unique properties that include high early strength, low shrinkage, freeze and thaw resistance, sulphate resistance and corrosion resistance, make them ideal in long term containment in surface disposal facilities and further these high alkali cements do not generate alkali aggregate reaction1.The development, the mixture proportions, and the short-term properties of low calcium flyash-based GPC  has been described and reported2 that one ton of low -calcium flyash can produce 2.5 cubic metres of high quality GPC , and the bulk cost of chemicals needed to manufacture this concrete is cheaper than the bulk cost of one ton of Portland cement.

It is concluded that low -calcium flyash  based GPC  has excellent compressive strength, suffers very little drying shrinkage and low creep, excellent resistance to sulfate attack, and good acid resistance. The literature survey on GPCs indicating the qualitative information available on the mechanical properties of GPC mixes  is presented3, sufficient to develop GPCs for use in structures. It is reported that it is possible to practically formulate the alkali activating solution for class F flyash , GGBS  and in different combination to achieve strength levels useful in civil Engineering application and it is therefore possible to prepare typical structural members such as beams and columns using the GPCs capable of being cured under ambient conditions onl y for studying the possibility of applicability in existing structural design guidelines to new composites.

A comprehensive summary also presented4from the extensive studies conducted on flyash  based GPC. Test data are used to identify the effects of sali ent factors that influence the properties of the GPC  in the fresh and hardened states. These results are utilized to propose a simple method for the design of GPC  mix proportions. Test data of various short term and long -term properties of the GPC  are then  presented. Critical discuss ion5on opportunities, limitations, and future needs for the development in GPC for producing a sustainable concrete  is made and summarized that the technology of geopolymerization is not new and is believed to have been used in the construction of the Pyramids at Giza, Egypt, (circa 2550 B.C.) and other ancient construction of the Mohenjo -Daro, in Sindh, Pakistan, (circa 2600 BC) a nd however GPC technology is still mostly confined at laboratory levels.

Explanations on the geopolymers based on, Kaolinite/Hydrosodalite,Metakaolin MK -750, Calcium, Rock, Silica, flyash , Phosphate and organic minerals are also reported on the developmen t of GPC from these source materials as the attempts of scientists from various origins.  Apart from other aspects, a good quantum of flyash  is available in India, but to date its utilization is limited inspite of the codal recommendations.R eview  on the flyash  scenario in India  particularly for its generation and utilization in India, characterization and advantages of its applications in concrete and in agriculture are explained  and addressed. It is reported that flyash  generation is expected to incre ase to 300 million tons per annum by 2017 and 900 million tons per annum by 2031 -32.An overall view of the process and parameters which affect the geo -polymer concrete till date  is also given10. The economic benefits and contribution of GPC  to sustainable development have been outlined and it is reported that no Indian Standards are available so a detailed study on the chemistry behind the polymerization is needed.

Experimental investigation made on the performance of class C flyash  based GP C subjected to severe environmental conditions and compared with conventional concrete of M30, M40, M50 and M60 grades is presented11. Sodium hydroxide solution (8M and 12M) and sodium silicate with ratio of 2.50 and 3.50 were used. The test results indica ted that the heat -cured (60Â°C for 24 hours) flyash based GPC  had an excellent resistance to Sulphuric acid and magnesium sulphate attack when compared to conventional concrete. Relationship between the activator composition and the properties of class C flyash  based geopolymer mortar in fresh and hardened states is also establish esd12. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X - ray spectroscopy and X -ray diffraction techniques were also used to characterize the material  and indicate d thepotential available for the concrete industry to use flyash based GPC as an alternative to Portland cement.

Numerous geopolymer systems have been proposed (many are patented), most are difficult to work with and require great care in their fabr sication. Furthermore, there is a safety risk associated with the high alkalinity of the activating solution, and high alkalinity also requires more processing, resulting in increased energy consumption and greenhouse gas generation. Also the  polym erization reaction is very sen sitive to temperature and usually requires that the GPC  be cured at elevated temperature under a strictly controlled temperature regime. In many respects, these facts may limit the practical use of GPC  in the transportation for precast applications. Considerable research to develop GPC  that address these technical hurdles, creating a low embodied energy, low carbon dioxide binder that has simi lar properties to Portland cement is under way. In addition,  current research is to focusing on the development of userfriendly GPC.

It is worth to note that only few studies have been made on high calcium flyash  based GPC  compared to low calcium flyash  based GPC. Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) is a lignite bas ed unit generating power through two  major  thermal Power stations and annually produces 1.20 million tons of high calcium flyash (ASTM class C) .As the utilization is v ery much limited, storing of ash is a hectic problem. Therefore, there is a need of mass utilization of this flyash  for structural purpose. As the high calcium flyash  is more cementitious compared to low calcium flyash , an experimental study is initiated for promoting high calcium flyash  based GPC.  In order to simplify the development process, the compressive strength was selected as the benchmark parameter.

Contituents and Design Parameters 
In skelet on the important details of production of GPC from the literature are summarized here:
 - The source material :flyash , GGBS, Rice husk ash, metakaolin  or calcined kaolin , etc.,
 - The activating solution  (type and silicate/hydroxide ratio):  Sodium based (Na 2SiO 3/NaOH) or Potassium based ( K2SiO 3/KOH ) having a ratio 1.5 to 3.0 with hydroxide of varying molarities (8 -16M).
 - Water/Geopolymer = [Mass of water in the solution of silicate, hydroxide and exrra water if any]/[Mass of fly ash and mass of solids in silicate and hydroxide solutions]
 - Curing: After casting, the fresh concrete specimens are placed in the oven for dry curing or in the steam curing chamber for steam curing with a curing temperature ranging from 60oC to 100oC. Ambient curing (at room temperature)  is also successfully attempted .

Experimentation 
For conventional concrete, ordinary Portland cement having specific gravity 3.14 is used. High calcium flyash  (ASTM Class C) from the Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) having specific gravity 2.24 and fineness 325 m2/kg is used as the main source material for GPC . NLC is lignite  based thermal power station annually producing 1.20 million tons of class C flyash .  The chemical composition of the flyash  procured for the research is shown in Table 1.

Conventional aggregates like fine river sand(specific gravity 2.64) and 12.5mm coarse aggregates (specific gravity 2.7) are used. The commonly available sodium hydroxide (Analytical grade in pellets form with 98% purity) and sodium silicate solution(with Na 2O = 12%, SiO 2 = 30%, and wat er = 58% by mass) in combination is used as the alkaline activator. Mix design for conventional concrete M30 and for GPC  GM30 is made based on the material properties and requirements. The views of constituent materials are shown in figure 1.

Preparation of Activating Solution 
The molar concentrations of NaOH considered are 8M, 10M, 12M and 14M.The activator/ flyash  ratio by mass is 0.35 and the liquid ratio of the activating solution is 2.5. For in stance, 8 Molar NaOH consists of 8Ã40 = 320gm of Solid NaOH per litre of solution where, 40 is its molecular weight. The mass of NaOH solids is measured to be 262 gms /kg of NaOH solution. Similarly, the details for other molarities are given in Table 2.
The NaOH solution is prepared 24 hours prior to use, because after dissolving flakes of NaOH in water, the temperature of solution can go up to 80oC, hence it is necessary to cool it at room temperature before use . The NaOH solution thus prepared was mixed together with Sodium silicate solution to get desired alkaline solution. These solution s are mixed  together one day before adding the liqu id to th e solid dry constituents.

Casting and Testing of Specimens 
Using the constituents, conventional concrete of M30 grade and equivalent grade of GPC  designated as GM30 are designed and trial mixes prepared. The mix proportions for the trial mix and the quantities required for one meter cube of concrete are given in Table 3. The dry materials (flyash and aggregates) are then mixed in the pan mixer for about three minutes and the acti vating solution premixed with admixture is added to the dry mixture, and mixing continued for another three minutes.

After discharge from the mixer machine, workability test was conducted and slump value obtained. The concrete is poured in the cube moulds of 100mm size in three layers and compacted by placing on the table vibrator. After finishing the top, the specimens are wrapped by placing a lid on the mould. Dry curing in the laboratory oven f or 24 hours at 65oC as well as ambient curing (at room temperature of 29Â±1oC that exists) is adopted. The compressive strength of various concrete specimens is obtained by testing these 100mm cubes at appropriate days. The results are presented in Table 4 and the comparison is made in figure 2.

II. DISCUSSION 
 - The preparation of alkali ne solution is very much comfortable and mixing is very convenient. The GPC is also fairly workable. Being 100mm cubes, hot curing is feasible for more number of specimens.
 
 - The compressive strength of geopolymer increases generally for oven curing for all molar concentrations (8M-14M) but reduces after 12M in case of ambient curing. Upto 10M concentration, the compressive strength of GPC is less by 5 -10% compared to conventional concrete.
 - The compressive strength of ambient cured concrete is 3.15% more than the hot cured concrete up to 10M concentration and 1% and 4% less for molar concentrations of 12M and 14M respectively.
 - Extra water is required for concrete with higher m olar concentrations of sodium hydroxide solution like 12M and 14M to make them workable with a slump of 40mm.

III. CONCLUSIONS
 - Confined to the experimental study in developing high calcium flyash  based GPC  of equivalent M30 grade concrete , ambient curing of co ncrete at room temperature for 28 days is adequate.
 - 12M molar concentration of NaOH is optimum for the designed compressive strength.
 - Hot curing is not required under laboratory conditions. However, in case of fabrication of precast elements , steam or hot curing shall be recommended.
